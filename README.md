# BSH_Task2
Small application which shows a list of movies details by specified parameters written in Python and based on Tkinter  
Data from: https://rapidapi.com/gox-ai-gox-ai-default/api/ott-details (OTT details)  
In the main window (Movie parser), the user can set the parameters by which films will be selected:  
- IMDB (the minimum score to be searched for)
- Genre (Action, Drama, Comedy, Romance, Adventure etc.)
- Date (the time period in which the films were released)
- Sort (sorting movies by rating, popularity etc.)

After clicking on the 'SEARCH' button, a second window appears, in which it is divided into two parts:  
- In the upper part, all found films are displayed (title, released year, genre, imdb)
- At the bottom is a JSON file
